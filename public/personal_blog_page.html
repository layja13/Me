            <ul>
                <li> I am an over passionate. Literally I can get instrinsecaly pasionated about anything if you let me explore it.</li>
                <br>
                <li> I am for life interested in my own pshychology and the one of the others, and also about my own consciousness and metacognition.</li>
                <br> 
                <li> I really love science and research. From mathematics, physics, biology to psychology and social sciences. Please give it a look and some read to my <a href="./research_page.html">Research Page</a>.</li>
                <br>
                <li> I am currently obsessed with the word "Abstraction" and its profundity, and how everything can be represented as nodes (Graph Theory) which are entirely abstract, and Complexity Science.</li>
                <br>
                <li> I do believe people are the most important thing in the world, it goes beyond any science and purpose for happiness and satisfaction.</li>
                <br>
                <li> I own a great social ability, but I really struggle to create deeper relationships and enjoy the majority of social interactions. Sometimes because of my own unconfidence, many other times because of lack of afinity, 5% I found one person to form a real relationship, and it's deeply great, amazing and significant. I have discovered that I have a passion to flirt with girls, get fun on that process and enjoy it. I got very unconfident with girls after high school (even though I had a good long-term relationship) and I am now in the process to play while letting it happen again gradually, because I love girls. I really enjoy being alone, and enjoy the things I like alone, I am really happy with the things I do alone. Find a person (or people) to share some of these moments, I think is difficult, and I am not expecting to find it in the short term at least, but would be extremely special, and of course that literally would be like one person in, probably, one hundred thousand.</li>
